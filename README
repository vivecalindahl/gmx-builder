# BACKGROUND
This set of python and bash scripts demonstrating how one can automate a fairly complex, but typical, GROMACS (gmx) simulation study. The chosen use case is investigating sequence dependency of base pair opening in a DNA double helix. The scientific aim in this case is to determine the opening free energy as a function of the base pair type and the DNA sequence. The DNA molecule is modeled as being periodically connected (infinitely long) and two forcefields are applied. The AWH method (available in gmx) is used to calculate the PMF along a reaction coordinate for the opening process, which is then averaged over multiple simulation. All in all, this requires building and managing many different simulation systems, which is error prone, tedious and not very reproducible if performed manually.

I have previously performed such a study (see http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005463) essentially by patching together smaller python and bash scripts and one very large bash script. Here I have mainly used python. Obviously, gmx is designed for working directly in the terminal so it can be quite awkward (at first?) to use gmx tools from within a python script. There are definitely advantages to wrapping it all in python though, especially when organizing input parameters and keeping the whole process contained and modular. It's quite simplistic coding-wise, but hopefully it can still be elucidating as a prototype for a representative workflow.

# WHAT THE SCRIPTS DO
For now, the scripts only take care of the building process of the gmx systems and generating run directories that are essentially "ready to run" (automating simulation management is another story...).

# HOW TO TEST
Easiest is to from some interactive python program, e.g. in ipython do:

> sys.path.append('/PATH/TO/gmx-builder/scripts/')
> import build_dna_runs as bdna
> os.mkdir('build')
> os.chdir('build')
> bdna.example_build()

which should build an example DNA simulation setup into './build'.

# IDEA OF USAGE
For a new study, one would have to write a python script similar to './scripts/build_dna_runs.py'. Less system-specific functionalities that are reusable would be implemented into ./scripts/gmx_builder.py'

# OUTLOOK/TODOS
This use case hopefully helps delineate what functionalities are useful to include in a gmx to python framework and which components should be up to the user to design. The currently most popular package for interfacing gmx and python is, it seems from my enquiries, GromacsWrapper (https://orbeckst.github.io/GromacsWrapper/). Another option is BioPhysCode (https://biophyscode.github.io/). Likely there is quite some overlap with my own "wrapper" gmx-builder.

# ADDITIONAL NOTES
These scripts have been tested using gmx 2018.1.
