# This is V. Lindahl's addition of the Amber99 BSC1 parameters to GROMACS. It is an extension of
# A. Villa's GROMACS implementation of the Amber99 BSC0 DNA forcefield addition.

#2011-02-17 A.Villa implementation only for DNA
1) add atomtype CI to atomtypes.atp (corresponding to C5')
2) add bonded interaction involving CI to ffbonded.itp.
 4 CI bond and 11 CI angle parameters identical to CT,
 12 dihedral parameters identical to CT and 12 new dihedral parameters (convesion 1 kcal= 4.184 kJ)
3) add non-bonded interaction  ffnonbonded.itp. CI=CT
4) replace in "C5'    CT" with  "C5'    CI" in dna.rtp

# Description of the changes relevant from going to BSC0 to BSC1

atomtypes.atp [done]
--------------
# Added atomtypes CE, C1, C2

dna.rtp [done]
-----------
# Changed mappings of atom name -> atomtype_old to atom_name atomtype_new as:
C3': CT -> CE for residues A, T, G, C
C8 : CK -> C1 for residues A          # no CK (or C8) for residues T and C. No change for C8 of G
C5 : CM -> C2 for residues T          # no CM for residues A, G. No change for residue C
C6 : CM -> C2 for residues T          # no CM for residues A, G. No change for residue C

ffbonded.itp [done]
------------
# For CE, C1, C2:

1) Added bonds
-----------------
# In frcmod the bonds are listed as e.g.
CI-H1  340.0    1.090
# which is the bond between CI and H1 with force constant 340 in kcal/mol/Angstr^2 and
# equilibrium distance 1.090 in Angstr.
# The conversion to GROMACS force constant i kJ/mol/nm^2 is

k_gmx = k_amber*4.184*100*2

# where 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ (excactly) and 1/Angstr^2 = 100/nm^2 and the factor of 2 is
# for a different force constant definition in Amber and Gromacs
# (this can be verified e.g. by transforming a standard atomtype from Amber to Gromacs).

# The distance is converted as d_gmx = 0.1*d_amber.

2) Added angletypes
Both Amber and Gromacs have parameters in degrees.
Force constant has units of kJ/mol/rad^2 in Gromacs and in kcal/mol/rad^2 so

k_gmx = k_amber*4.184*2

3) Added dihedraltypes

In the Amber frcmod files the dihedrals are listed e.g. as

;IPT , JPT , KPT , LPT , IDIVF , PK , PHASE , PN
C2-C2-C -O     1       2.175     180.0        -2.

IPT, JPT, KPT LPT = the involved atomtypes
IDIVF =
"The factor by which the torsional barrier is divided. Consult Weiner, et al., JACS 106:765 (1984) p. 769 for details. Basically, the actual torsional potential is
(PK/IDIVF) * (1 + cos(PN*phi - PHASE))"
PHASE = the phase shift angle (deg) in the torsional function.
PN    = The periodicity of the torsional barrier. (negative values are just marking that
there are several terms to this torsional potential and these are read until the next
non-negative value).

Two old dihedral parameters needed to be removed since they conflicted with new bsc1 params.

a) proper periodic dihedrals
Same definition as improper periodic dihedrals but all atoms are consequtive.
Gromacs function type = 9 since there are multiple dihedrals (of different multiplicity)
for the same set of atomtypes.

Conversion of force constant (no additional factor of 2 here...):
k_gmx = k amber*4.184 = (PK/DIVF)*4.184
(confirmed by comparing a standard entry in amber99 in gromacs and amber14)

Used: awk '{ans=4.184*$2/$1; printf("%.10g\n",ans)}' cols_DIVF-PK.dat > out.dat

b) improper periodic dihedrals
Same as for proper dihedrals but DIVF=1 and the gromacs function type = 4

Three additional errors needed to be fixed:
1) the parmbsc0 implementation had the wrong order CT CT OS CI. The correct one is: CI CT OS CT (or CT OS CT CI).
2) the line "CE  CT  OS  CT    9      0.0       1.60247      3" was missing in parmBSC1.frcmod and had to be added to ffbonded.itp manually.
3) all dihedrals containing atomtype 'X' should be written out last so that this doesn't override any more specific terms.

ffnonbonded.itp [done]
------------
Added atomtype CE with same nonbonded params as CT
Added atomtype C1 with same nonbonded params as CK
Added atomtype C2 with same nonbonded params as CM
